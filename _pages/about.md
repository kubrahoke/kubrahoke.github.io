I am Teaching Associate at Lancaster University Management School. I defended my Ph.D. thesis in economics at the Bogazici University in October 2022 under the supervision of Murat Koyuncu.

My primary research focus is in the field of macroeconomics, with a specific emphasis on growth and taxation.
